WBFS Manager is a helpful app to manage all hard drives and USB drives formatted with the WBFS format of the Nintendo Wii.

With the program you have the possibility to transfer backup copies of your favorite games from the PC to the hard drive.

All you have to do is connect the device to the PC and load the unit with the WBFS Manager. If you are doing this for the first time, you will be asked if the drive should be formatted to be supported by the Wii. Therefore, it is also important to use the drive exclusively for the Wii, because the WBFS format is only compatible with the Wii, not with Windows.
